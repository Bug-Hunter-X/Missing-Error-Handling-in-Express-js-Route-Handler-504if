This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file showcases a route that lacks proper error handling when an invalid user ID is provided.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, including more informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling for creating reliable and maintainable applications.
